  ─────storyline─────
Overall our rpg game is devided
into three different parts which
are all presented by a specific 
island and asscociated fights. 
That means if the player was
able to complete every 
single island he wins the game.

The story should be like this, 
that all of these three islands 
are suffering from a dangerous 
slime invasion and the char has to
rescue the citiziens from the slimes by
fighting against them.

He beginns in his own villige and moves to
the other islands by boat. He interacts
with different citiziens and the game action 
is supported by helpful commentaries.

During the game he gains experience and 
rises in level what influences his strength. 

The slimes get stronger from island to 
island what leads to the point that the char 
first has to fight against the weaker ones 
and is able to move on after.
