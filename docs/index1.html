      <h2>Our game</h2>
      <p>
Our game is a rpg game based on the 
pokemon game series and the associated
game princips. Overall our rpg game is devided
into three different parts which
are all presented by a specific 
island and asscociated fights. The youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA">Chris Courses</a> was thereby our inspiration and he provided us with some usable sprites and ideas. 
      </p>
      <h4>Storyline</h4>
      <p>
All of the three islands, which represent the whole game world, 
are suffering from a dangerous 
slime invasion. Save and rescue the citiziens from the slimes by
fighting against them whith your own white pet slime, Alex!
You begin the game in your own villige and move on to
the other islands by boat. You are going to have to interact
with different citiziens who provide you with helpful commentaries and hints.
Every time you beat slimes, you gain experience and 
rise in level what influences the battle strength of your slime, Alex. 
The enemy slimes get stronger from island to island, which are reachable by boat, so first 
you have to beat the slimes of the first island and rise in experience 
and level up to be able to move on and fight the enemy slimes of the next islands.
The whole population of The Three Islands are counting on you, so hurry up and good Luck!

    <section id="procedure">
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <h4>Step-1, map creation</h4>
      <p>First, good sprites and sources for the map and the player had to be found. 
        These sprites were then imported to the map editor named <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org">Tiled</a>. With this tool
        our map could be created by layering our sprites up to a specific layer, which all togeter 
        form a map. Step by step the map was enlarged and details were added to it. Very important were 
        also the collisions and the map boundaries, which already had to be placed in the map editor. 
        Furthermore the foreground layers had to be fixed, so that the player could walk behind trees ect. 
        what made the game more realistic. 
     </p>
      <h4>Step-2, player and map development</h4>
      <p>
        Now the map had to be develpoed into the game and the char was created. First of all our created maps were exported into our programming code.
        Then the char was created and the movement was added by the keys w,a,s,d. Important is, that it is not the char, which is moving, but the map.
        Next the collision detection for all our different maps was added. Ensuing the char's animation for the movement.
      </p>
      <h4>Step-3, battle sequences</h4>
      <p>
        The battle sequences were created and added to the game and the transition from the map to the battle sequence was appended.
        Also the battle system, the health bars and the attack animations were inplemeted. This required good scources for the good looks and graphics of the 
        battle sequence, including the background and additional sprites and battle aspects. 
      </p>
      <h4>Difficulties</h4>
      <p>
        During the game creation, some difficulties were introduced. First of all there wasn't enough time to finish our game completely. The first created map with tiled woudn't work properly, which led to the use of some prebuild map for the beginning. The following maps were fixed but there wasn't enough time to conect them. 
        If there was more time available, the map creation would have been improved and all different maps would be used. There wasn't also enough time to make the transtion to reach the next maps by steping on the boat. So at the end, one entire map whit all it's aspects was prgrammed and created. 
        Due to the time constraints, the NPC's, which would have given some helpful commentaries and hints were not finished.
      </p>
      <h4>Current problems and outlook</h4>
      <p>
        With our current state of the game, the most important foundations for the further development of our game have been laid. The movement, the enemies, the map logic and the important battle scene are in place. 
        On this version, we could now develop the other aspects, such as interacting with NPCs or travelling to other worlds within a very short time. However, since our game is also very complex and many different aspects have to be taken into account, we also encountered numerous challenges during our work. Our current problem, which we recently addressed, was the adjustment of the player's position after the fight scene, as the player reappears at the same position after the fight and thus another fight is automatically triggered. 
        Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we did not manage to fix this problem, but the ideas for solving the problem are already present in our minds.

      <h2>Colaboration</h2>
      <p>The game "Slime Invasion" was developed by Lionel Frey and Nathan Boillat. The project was distributed according to strength and skill, while Nathan Boillat would be more focused on the different aspects of the grafics of the different maps and sprites, as well as on the creation of the Website of the game.
        Lionel Frey used his good programming skills to mainly programme the movement of the char, the addaptation of the map into the game, the battle sequences and everything, what comes around it. Our only and main issue was only the time constraints. </p>

    <section id="commands">
    <h2>Commands and handling</h2>
    <p>Our game is an rpg game map. To move on the map and win, use the  keys; W to move upwards, S to move downwards, A to move left, and D to move right.
    Within the fight scene, everything is automatic and strictly regulated. By pressing an attack button, Alex executes one of his currently learned attacks and damages the opponent. The opponent then attacks with a variable attack of his choice. This game principle is repeated until one of the two fighting Slimes has no more life points and the fight is over.
